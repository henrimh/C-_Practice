# Cpp_Practice
I've recently started doing C++ exercises on the site HackerEarth.
This is because I've done so much C# and I want to brush up my C++.

The exercises are arranged to different categories according to the categories on the site. 

The ObjectOrientedExercises was created hastily to re-memorize the principles of object oriented programming in C++.
  - Abstraction
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Encapsulation
